= Cache Observer

Run user-defined script after clearing the cache.
Script can be specified in app_root/config/cache.yml. If this file is not existed,
the plugin will try to get script from app_root/vendor/extension/cache_observer/config/cache.yml.

You just should copy app_root/vendor/extension/cache_observer/config/cache.yml to app_root/config/cache.yml
and set script there.
